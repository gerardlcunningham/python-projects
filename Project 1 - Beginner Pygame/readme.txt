Simple beginner's Pygame.

It is a two-player space-themed shooter game. The players control two spaceships, one red and one yellow, and the objective
is to shoot each other while avoiding incoming missiles. The game ends when one player's health reaches zero and the 
winner is displayed on the screen. After a brief pause, the game restarts.
